Final placement was determined by a Majority Placement rule.  Thus, if a pair were ranked first by a majority of the judges, that pair was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the pairs were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each pair determined who was ranked higher.  The tiebreakers were then, in order, 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals, 4) Total Points.",na,,,

Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the couples were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each couple determined who was ranked higher.  The tiebreakers were then, in order: 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The placement for the Compulsory Dance #1 was factored by 0.2 (10%), the placement for the Compulsory Dance #2 was factored by 0.2 (10%), the placement for the optional set dance was factored by 0.6 (30%), and the placement for Free Dance was factored by 1.0 (50%).

He was the hot favorite for another Olympic gold and was heading a strong East German team with the silver medalist from the 1974 World Championships Günther  Deckert and two promising youngsters, Konrad Winkler and Claus Tuchscherer on the team.
In ski jumping, Wehling showed excellent form, having the longest and best jump in all three rounds. His Finnish rival, Olympic silver medalist from 1972 Rauno Miettinen was in second place, followed by two more East Germans, Tuchscherer and Winkler.
Wehling, normally considered a better cross-country skier than Miettinen, started three minutes behind the Finn and could easily control his rival in the 15 km cross-country event the day after. The surprise of the event was Urban Hettich, a West German from Schwarzwald, who had been very satisfied with his 11th place in the jumping event. He skied excellently, posting the fastest time of the day, over a minute better than the second best, Norwegian Stein Erik Gullikstad. Hettich advanced to the silver medal position, beating Winkler by a scant margin in the final classification. Miettinen could do no better than 19th place in the cross-country, dropping from second to fourth, barely beating Tuchscherer in fifth place. Gullikstad, placing 30th out of 33 in the jumping event, was far behind in the total points, but the third fastest in the cross-country race, while the Soviet Union’s Nikolay Nogovitsyn advanced from 16th to sixth place. Wehling, still only 23, became the second skier to defend his Olympic gold in Nordic Combined after Johan Grøttumsbråten did it in Lake Placid 44 years earlier.

Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.

The placement for the  the Short Program was factored by 0.5 (33.3%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (66.7%).

The points race consists of a longer-distance track race, contested over 30 km. in the heats and 50 km. in the final in 1984. Points were awarded for sprints every two kilometers, while the final sprint awarded double points. The race placements were given to the riders who finish on the same lap, with the most points determining placements. A lapped rider could not gain points in any sprint. World championships had been contested in the points race since 1977. The 1983 World Champion was Denmark’s Michael Markussen, and he had also been on the podium at the 1981-82 World Championships, both won by East German riders. Forty-three riders started the first round, with the final consisting of 24 starters. Only two riders finished the final without being lapped – Roger Ilegems of Belgium and Uwe Messerschmidt (FRG). It was an easy gold medal for Ilegems with 37 points to 15 for Messerschmidt. Marcussen was lapped twice and placed ninth.

The 1964 gold medalist Tormod Knutsen had left competitive sport after his Olympic triumph, and 1960 champion Georg Thoma had ended his impressive career by winning gold at the 1966 World Championships in Oslo. The favorites for the 1968 Olympic title were the silver medalist from the 1966 World Championships, Thoma’s 23-year old teammate Franz Keller and the bronze medalist from the same championships, Switzerland’s Alois Kälin. The two rivals had different specialities. Keller was an average cross-country skier, but an excellent ski jumper, while Kälin was an excellent skier, placing 20th in the 1964 Olympic 50 km, where he was also 12th in the Nordic Combination, and he was a regular member of the Swiss 4x10 km relay team. Kälin was one of the few athletes competing in both cross-country and Nordic Combined at an international level.
In the first part of the Nordic Combined event, ski jumping, Keller showed excellent form and won with the longest jump of the day, 77.5 metres, achieved in the second round. His victory could have been clearer if he had not fallen on his third jump, which measured 77 m. An unknown Japanese, Hiroshi Itagaki, placed second and Erwin Fiedor, 14th in the 1964 games, was third. Fiedor was known as a rather mediocre cross-country skier, and Itagaki’s cross-country abilities were unknown. Kälin placed 24th out of 41 competitors and had to beat Keller by almost 3½ minutes in the 15 km cross-country phase, leaving Keller as the undisputed favorite for the gold medal.
In the skiing Kälin had the advantage of starting as number 40, Keller wearing start number 33. The starting time difference between the two was 3:30, almost exactly the time Kälin had to beat Keller to beat him in total points. It turned out to be a most dramatic duel. After 5 km, Kälin had gained 1:03 on his rival, but at the 10 km point he had gained 2:40, and Keller was only 50 seconds ahead of Kälin on the track. Could the Swiss take back 50 more seconds on the last 5 km? He fought gallantly, but in vain, passing the finishing line exactly 6.3 seconds behind Keller! East Germany’s Andreas Kunz secured the bronze medal, advancing from 10th position after the ski jumping after having the third fastest time in the cross-country. Fourth was the Czechoslovakian teenager Tomáš Kučera, and with an Italian in 5th and a Pole in sixth place it was obvious that the Nordic Combined was no longer a Nordic affair. The best Norwegian placed 21st, while the best of the Finns ended in 30th place.
East Germany’s  Ralph Pöhland had placed 4th in the 1966 World Championships and was expected to be one of the heavy favorites. After winning a pre-Olympic competition in Le Brassus, Switzerland in mid-January 1968, he defected to West Germany with the help of Georg Thoma. He was denied a start for West Germany in the Olympics by a decision of the FIS council, after strong political pressure from East Germany and the Soviet Union. A few days after the Olympics he won the West German championships, with Olympic Champion Keller in second place, and at the 1972 Games represented West Germany, placing 10th.

Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  The placement for the Compulsory Figures was factored by 0.6 (30%), the placement for the short program was factored by 0.4 (20%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (50%).

The 19-year old Japanese Hideki Nakano was outstanding in the jumping, with the longest and best jump in all of the three rounds. However, his abilities as a cross-country skier were rather modest, ending last in the cross-country event and placing 13th in the final classification. The great surprise of the event was another 19-year old, the East German Ulrich Wehling, placing fourth in the jumping event. To win, he had to beat his closest rival, the 22-year old Finn Rauno Miettinen by approximately one minute in the cross-country, and the young and unmerited German skied well, achieving the third fastest time of the day and beating Miettinen by almost two minutes. His team-mate Karl-Heinz Luck was fastest in the cross-country and advanced from 17th place in the jumping event to a bronze medal in the final classification.
This was the start of a rather unique career in Nordic Combined for Wehling, ending as the most successful Nordic Combined in the history of the Winter Olympics. He and Miettinen became the dominant figures in Nordic Combined for the rest of the decade. With his three Olympic Gold medals Wehling was the king of the Olympics. Miettinen is one of the few athletes who can claim five victories at the prestigious Holmenkollen.

But US politics did not give them the satisfaction of beating a USA basketball team. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, and US President Jimmy Carter announced in late January that he would support a boycott of the Moscow Olympics. This eventually occurred and the United States did not compete at the 1980 Olympic Games. Without the United States it was thought that the USSR would win easily, especially on their home turf. The Soviet coach loudly boasted that they would have won even if the Americans had competed and that the American withdrawal was because they were afraid of playing the Soviet team.
But in the semi-final pool, the Soviet Union lost twice – to Yugoslavia and Italy, and only finished 3rd in the pool. They played Spain for the bronze medal and won easily.  Yugoslavia defeated Italy, 86-77, for their first Olympic basketball gold medal. American basketball coach Dave Gavitt sent the Soviet coach, Aleksandr Gomelsky, a telegram congratulating him on their bronze medal.

Thus, if a pair was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall for that section.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule. The tiebreakers were then, in order, 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The placement for the Original Program was factored by 0.5 (33.3%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (66.7%).  The sums of the factored placements were then used to determine final placement, with the Free Skating being the tiebreaker.",na,,,

Sheffield Speed Skating Oval, Lake Placid / Intervale Ski Jump Complex, Lake Placid",33 from 10 countries,Normal hill ski jumping and 18 kilometres skiing, placements determined by points table.,"Norway had won all the medals in Nordic Combined at the two previous Olympics, and entered a strong team for the Lake Placid Games. The team was led by defending champion Johan Grøttumsbraaten, the king of skiing at the 1928 Olympics and World Champion in the event in 1926 and 1931, and Hans Vinjarengen, silver medalist from 1928 and World Champion in 1929 and 1930. The Norwegian lineup was completed by Ole Stenen, a cross country specialist and decent jumper, and 23-year old Sverre Kolterud, with jumping his strength.
In the 18 km. race Grøttumsbraaten and Stenen took advantage of their cross-country abilities to build up a decisive lead on the rest of the field. In third place was a big surprise, the unknown 23-year old Japanese Heigoro Kuriyagawa, who beat Vinjarengen by over a minute, and in 5th was another Japanese surprise, Takemitsu Tsubokawa. The Scandinavian experts were wondering about the Japanese skills on the jumping hill.
Best in the ski jumping section was Fritz Kaufmann with two solid jumps of 59.5 and 60.5 meters, but since he was over 32 minutes behind the winner in cross country, he was no threat in the overall standings. Vinjarengen placed second in jumping with 54.0 and 60.0 meters (longest in the competition), but was barely beaten by Stenen in the overall standings. However, no one could threaten Grøttumsbraaten from defending his title. Finishing 6th in the jump, he won by a clear margin, and ended his Olympic career with three gold, one silver and two bronze medals. As the Norwegians had hoped for, Kolterud was able to advance to 4th place, beating the best non-Norwegian Sven Eriksson (later Selånger) clearly. Kuriyagawa turned out to be a decent jumper, but a fall in the first round relegated him to 20th place, and his countryman Tsukokawa had the shortest jumps of the day and placed 15th overall.

Norway had an outstanding Winter Olympic record in this event, winning all the medals at the three previous games, and all members of their quartet in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, headed by double world champion Oddbjørn Hagen, was especially strong in cross country. The Norwegians placed 1-2-3-6 in the 18 km. with Hagen in a clear lead, over 2 minutes ahead of Olaf Hoffsbakken and 3:36 ahead of the best non-Norwegian, František Šimůnek from Czechoslovakia in 4th place. However, at the 1935 World Championships, the Finn Lauri Valonen had taken 2nd place and the German Willy Bogner was 3rd in front of two Norwegians, due to good jumping results. In spite of moderate jumping results, the Norwegians once again claimed all the medals in Garmisch. Hagen and Hoffsbakken jumped safely and won the gold and silver easily by a clear margin. Sverre Brodahl was in trouble after a bad first jump measuring only 40 m., but was able to keep the winner of the ski jump Valonen behind in the fight for the bronze medal. Valonen had the best jumps in both rounds with 52 and 54.5 m., advancing from 26th place in the cross country to 4th place overall. The surprise man from the cross country part, Šimůnek, was able to stay ahead of the fourth Norwegian, Bernt Østerkløft, by only 0.5 points, ending 5th.
Oddbjørn Hagen ended his international skiing career in an impressive way, taking his third championship gold in a row. Germany had the second best jumper in the competition, but Toni Eisgruber was a mediocre cross country skier and ended as 23rd in the overall standings. Bogner’s 12th place was a disappointment for the Germans. Gustl Berauer, representing Czechoslovakia, ended up as 14th. He was a Sudeten-German, and after the German occupation of the Sudetenland in 1938, Berauer competed for Germany and became world champion in Nordic Combined at Zakopane in 1939.

Slåttvik had emerged as Hasu’s closest rival, winning the prestigious Holmenkollen Nordic Combined both in 1950 and 1951 and beating Hasu on both occations. In 1950 is was a very close contest, but in 1951 Hasu fell in two of his three jumps and was out of contention for the victory. Slåttvik had now moved from his birthplace in Nordland to Lillehammer, which made it much easier for him to train and participate in important competitions.
At the Olympic Games in Oslo, the schedule of events for the Nordic Combined had changed. For the first time the ski jumping was the first part of the competition, and the 18 km cross-country part was scheduled the day after, and as usual combined with the specialist’s race.
The audience of almost 30,000 held their breath when home favorite Slåttvik fell in his first jump measuring 67.5 m, the longest in the first round. The two best jumps of three counted, and the pressure was on Slåttvik. He produced two excellent jumps in superb style and ended as winner of the jumping event, 0.5 point better than his countryman Sverre Stenersen, a 25-year-old newcomer to the team and like Slåttvik also from the northern part of Norway. Stenersen had the longest jump of the day, jumping 69.5 m in the third round. Hasu, however, jumped better than expected and placed fifth in the event. He had to beat Slåttvik by 4:32 minutes in the cross-country, and that was considered quite possible since Hasu was an excellent cross-country skier, a medal candidate among the specialists.
Hasu again made an excellent 18 km, missing the bronze medal among the specialist with only 4 seconds and beating his closest rival among the Nordic Combined participants, his countryman Paavo Korhonen, by over three minutes. Slåttvik, however, made his best cross-country competition ever. With massive support from an enthusiastic home crowd, he crossed the finish line with a time only 3:16 behind Hasu, placing third in the cross-country and winning the Olympic gold with a clear margin. Stenersen was able to keep ahead of Korhonen and secured the bronze, even if he was beaten by Hasu by over seven minutes.

His teammate, Tormod Knutsen, younger by five years but the National Champion in 1959-60 and winner at Holmenkollen in 1958, was considered as Norway’s gold favorite for the 1960 Olympics. Finland’s 1958 World Champion, Paavo Korhonen, was an excellent cross-country skier, but his jumping was very variable and he was depending on two good jumps to be able to fight for the medals.
The Nordic Combination started with the ski jumping event as in the last two Winter Olympic Games. Georg Thoma, a 22-year-old from Hinterzarten in West Germany, won the jumping event ahead of Soviet Union’s Dmitry Kochkin and the Japanese Yosuke Eto, but all three were considered too weak in the cross-country event to contend for the gold medal. Thoma had recently won the West-German championships in ski jumping. Tormod Knutsen, lying fourth after the jumping event, was considered as the main favorite for the gold. World Champion Paavo Korhonen, placing only a modest 24th, seemed out of contention.
The cross-country race on the next day produced some surprising results. George Thoma skied well and produced the fourth fastest time of the day, holding off Tormod Knutsen and won the gold medal with a clear margin over his Norwegian opponent. Nikolay Gusakov of the Soviet Union, a 25-year old Karelian married to 10 km Olympic Champion Mariya Gusakova, was the fastest skier of the day and advanced from tenth place in the jumping event into bronze medal position. Pekka Ristola from Finland placed sixth in both events and advanced to fourth place, ahead of Kochkin, who produced a decent cross-country race but could not defend his silver position from the jumping event.
Georg Thoma, after his breakthrough at the 1960 Olympics, emerged as one of the greatest all-time athletes in Nordic Combined. He won the Holmenkollen event in 1963, 1964 and 1965, and crowned his skiing career as World Champion in the same arena in 1966. He won another Olympic medal by placing third at the 1964 Games in Innsbruck.

The Finnish boat “Örn” came in on third place twice and finished a thankless overall fourth place with two points. In the sail-off for the silver medal “Sans Atout” won by almost one minute, after a fierce struggle, with the lead alternating a few times.

They had finished in that order at the 1994 World Championships and were expected to continue that trend in Atlanta. In fact, the eight entered nations at the 1996 Olympics finished in the exact order they had at the 1994 Worlds. The United States won the event, led by Becky Dyroen-Lancer, who was certainly deprived of more medals by the change in the program. Since the 1992 Olympics, she had recorded nine consecutive Grand Slams – winning solo, duet, team, and figures titles at every meet, including the 1994 World Championships and 1995 Pan-American Games. The French team caused controversy with their plans for the original routine, which was to consist of an enactment of Jewish women at a concentration camp making their final walk to the gas chambers. Shortly before the Olympics, they were convinced of how inappropriate this was and French IOC Member and Minister of Sports, Guy Drut, forbade from using their original routine.

The points were based on 30% for Compulsory Figures, 20% for the Short Program, and 50% for Free Skating, with the tiebreaker for each judge being the Free Skating score.  Final placement was determined by a Majority Placement rule.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals, 4) Total Points.",na,,,

It was therefore a great shock for the nation when the Swede Sven Israelsson, in front of a home crowd of 70 000, could as the first foreigner be celebrated as the winner of Nordic Combined in Holmekollen 1947. And that was not enough: Second was the Swiss skier Niklaus Stump, and the best Norwegian Olaf Dufseth had to be satisfied by third place. The Norwegians had been warned.
In St. Moritz the 18 km Cross Country part of Nordic Combined was integrated in the event for the specialists, and the results of the Nordic Combined participants counted for this event. Out of 84 starters, 39 of them participated in the combined event.
The day brought another shock to the Norwegians, this time coming from their Finnish neighbors. One of the youngest participants in the competition, the 21 year old and unmerited Heikki Hasu, outclassed his opponents and was almost 3 minutes ahead of his countryman, the more merited Martti Huhtala. The best Norwegian in third place, Olav Odden, was beaten by Hasu with almost 5 minutes, and Israelsson and Stump, both considered as having their best event in jumping, were close behind Odden. Hasu’s excellent race placed him 4th among the specialist, only 36 seconds behind the bronze winner.
In the jumping event the day after, each skier had 3 jumps, and only the two best jumps counted. Hasu jumped safely and won the gold medal with a clear margin. Israelsson was the best jumper of all, but was not able to catch Huhtala in the battle for silver and had to settle for bronze. Stump advanced  from 7th to 4th place. For the Norwegians, the jumping event went even worse than the cross country part. Odden jumped badly and fell down to 11th place. Their best jumper, Eilert Dahl, placed 8th in the jumping event and could advance to a 6th place in the final results. The US skiers Gordon Wren and Corey Engen impressed by coming 2nd and 3rd in the jumping event, but were too far behind in the cross country race to fight for a top placing in the final ranking.
Some of the lost Norwegian pride was restored in Holmenkollen a few weeks later, when Simon Slåttvik, aged 30 and coming from the northern part of Norway, won the Nordic Combined with another Norwegian outside the Olympic team, Ottar Gjermundshaug in 2nd place. Huhtala was 3rd and Israelsson a distant 14th, but Hasu and Stump was not taking part. Slåttvik became Norwegian Champion in 1947, but could not raise money enough to travel to the Norwegian Olympic selection competitions early in the 1948 season.

The tiebreaker for the Short Program was the Required Elements score, while the tiebreaker for the Free Skating was the Artistic Impression score.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall for that section.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  The placement for the Compulsory Figures was factored by 0.6 (30%), the placement for the short program was factored by 0.4 (20%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (50%).  The sums of the factored placements were then used to determine final placement, with the Free Skating being the tiebreaker.",na,,,

Thoma was injured during the ski jumping competition at the 1962 World Championships and was out for the rest of the season, but came back strongly in 1963, winning at Holmenkollen and beating his arch rival Knutsen into second place. Knutsen was a very consistent competitor, but was still hunting for a major international win. At the 1962 World Championships he placed fourth, clearly behind the winner Arne Larsen. Larsen was normally an excellent jumper, winning the Norwegian Championships in ski jumping 1962, but when he trained harder to improve his cross country abilities, his jumping skills seemed to diminish during the 1963 and 1964 seasons.
The ski jumping part of the Nordic Combined took place on the Normal Hill in Seefeld with Thoma as the winner, but Knutsen, placing second, needed only 12 seconds to beat Thoma in the cross country event. The Soviet Union’s Nikolay Kiselyov came third in the jumping event, but was considered too weak in the cross country to fight for a medal. The bronze medalist of 1960 Nikolay Gusakov, seemed to be a better Soviet medal prospect after placing seventh in the ski jumping. Arne Larsen was disappointed with his 17th place in the jumping event, and the World Champion seemed to be out of contention for a medal.
In the 15 km cross country event Knutsen had a 31 seconds lead over Thoma by 5 km and at the finish he had beaten his rival with a clear margin, 1:33. Thoma had a bad day on the cross country track. He had trouble with his wax, and fell twice during the race. Kiselyov surprised with an excellent cross country race, beating Thoma by 42 seconds and taking the silver medal by a very small margin. Gusakov also made a good race and advanced from seventh to fourth place. Arne Larsen turned out to be the third fastest skier of the day and advanced from 17th to fifth place in the final standings. The Swiss Alois Kälin was clearly the fastest skier of the day, winning the cross country 1:28 ahead of his closest rival. Kälin could only place place 28 out of 32 competitors in the jumping event, but advanced to a final 12th position through his excellent cross country race.
Thoma got revenge over Knutsen by winning at Holmenkollen later in the season, where Knutsen was a distant sixth. Then the 32-year-old Norwegian ended his career, his old dream of an Olympic gold medal had come true.

The two other Norwegians, jumping specialists Ole Kolterud and John Snersrud were 7th and 9th in the cross country event, and the Norwegians had hopes for another 1-4 finish as in Chamonix. The jumping event was a formality for Grøttumsbraaten, and he secured his second gold medal in two days, placing 8th in the ski jumping. Vinjarengen, normally an excellent jumper, fell on his first jump, but due to his fast 18 km. time and a good second jump he was able to secure the silver medal. Snersrud advanced to bronze after coming 3rd in the jumping event. The fourth Norwegian, Ole Kolterud, was leading the jumping event after the first round, but a fall in the second round after the longest jump in the competition (65.5 m.) brought him down to 8th place in the overall standings and prevented Norway from sweeping the first four places.
The Czechoslovak Rudolf Burkert was the winner of the jumping event (with the longest jump standing in the competition of 62.5 m.) ahead of Italian Vitale Venzi, but both were too weak in the cross country event and ended as 12th and 20th in the final standings. Burkert won the World Championship title in Nordic Combined in Cortina, Italy in 1927, but with no Norwegians or Finns taking part.

Van Hoevenberg Recreation Area, Lake Placid",31 from 9 countries,Normal hill ski jumping and 15 kilometres skiing, placements determined by points table.,"The two-time defending Olympic champion, East Germany’s Ulrich Wehling, had dominated the international Nordic Combined scene during the 1970s. Besides his Olympic victories and World Championships gold he had won six national championships in the period 1973-1979 and was triumphant at Holmenkollen three years in a row – 1975, 1976 and 1977. His only international Championship defeat came at the 1978 World Championships in Lahti, were he finished third after his teammate Konrad Winkler and his arch-rival, the Finn Rauno  Miettinen. However, Wehling, still only 27, was only one of four main favorites for the 1980 Olympic gold. Winkler, reigning World Champion, was to be considered, and Norway had hopes to regain their supremacy in the event through Tom Sandberg, Norwegian Champion six times in a row between 1975 and 1980. Finland had produced a great prospect in 23-year old Jouko Karjalainen, an excellent cross-country skier who was dangerous if he could do well in the ski jumping.
Wehling started the competition well. He won the jumping by a comfortable margin, with the best jump in both of the first two rounds, producing the longest jump of the day in the second round with 85.0 m. Second was an unknown American, Walter Malmquist, and third a West German teenager, Hubert Schwarz. Winkler, who placed fifth in ski jumping, had to beat Wehling by 1:25 in the cross country event, and Karjalainen (1:58 back) and Sandberg (2:39 back) were still in contention for the medals. Malmquist and Schwartz were considered too weak in the cross-country event to have any impact on the medal race.
In the 15 km cross-country phase, Wehling had the advantage of starting behind his rivals, Winkler and Karjalainen. The most dangerous attack came from the Finn. After 5 km he had a ½-minute lead over Wehling, and at 10 km the lead had increased to one minute, but Karjalainen had to gain another minute during the last 5 km, an almost impossible task.  Wehling controlled the last part of the race and won his third consecutive Olympic Nordic Combined gold medal, a feat not performed before or since. Karjalainen, with the best cross-country time, advanced to the silver position, and Winkler, as in 1976, had to be content with the bronze medal. Sandberg edged out the East German Uwe Dotzauer in a close duel for fourth place. Miettinen, a shadow of his former self, ended in 23rd place, failing totally on the jumping hill.

Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall for that section.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  The placement for the Compulsory Figures was factored by 0.6 (30%), the placement for the short program was factored by 0.4 (20%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (50%).

He was Norwegian Champion nine times in the period 1974-1984, and to the great satisfaction of his home crowd he won the 1982 World Championship in Oslo. Sandberg’s best Olympic placing was fourth in 1980, but he decided to go for a medal in the 1984 Olympics before ending his career. His closest rivals were expected to come from East Germany and Finland. East Germany had not been able to fill the gap after the great Ulrich  Wehling retired, and Konrad Winkler, World Champion from 1978, ended his career after winning silver in the 1982 World Championships behind Sandberg. Their best was expected to be Uwe Dotzauer, bronze medalist in 1982. Finland’s Rauno Miettinen, now aged 34 and competing in his fourth and last Olympics, had silver medals from the 1972 Olympics and from the 1978 World Championships as his best international championships performances. He also strongly hoped to end his career as Olympic champion. However, Jouko Karjalainen, the 1980 silver medalist, was considered as Finland’s best card. He was an excellent cross-country skier, and if he could do reasonably well in the jumping event, he could challenge for Olympic gold.
Sandberg started well in the ski jumping, winning the event ahead of the relatively unknown Soviet skier, Sergey Chervyakov, with West Germany’s Thomas  Müller in third place. Miettinen placed sixth and Karjalainen was still in position for a medal, placing 15th out of the 28 competitors. Dotzauer jumped to 12th place and was a disappointment.
In the cross-country event, Karjalainen started one minute behind Sandberg as next-to-last of the 28 competitors, and had to beat his Norwegan rival by approximately 2:15 to pass him in the final classification. At 9 km he passed Sandberg on the cross-country track, but during the last six kilometers Sandberg gave away only 20 more seconds. Karjalainen won the cross-country race by a comfortable margin, but Sandberg placed second and could celebrate as the Olympic Champion. Karjalainen was an easy silver medalist and another Finn, 21-year old Jukka Ylipulli, was a surprise bronze medal winner after placing fifth in both the jumping and cross-country event. Miettinen ended his career by placing fourth, and West Germany’s Müller, third in the jumping event, was fifth, far better than expected.  Soviet’s Chervyakov dropped from second after the ski jump to 12th, but his 19-year old teammate, Ukrainian Aleksandr Prosvirnin advanced from 13th to sixth place, the best Soviet placing in Nordic Combined in twenty years.
Sandberg ended his last season impressively, winning the Nordic Combined World Cup for the 1983/84 season and finally winning another World Championship gold medal as a member of the Norwegian team in the Nordic combined team event in Rovaniemi, Finland in March. The Nordic combined team event had been held for the first time at the 1982 World Championships in Oslo.

After winning the Holmenkollen Nordic Combined in 1953, his rival Heikki Hasu also quit top sports. Led by bronze medallist from 1952, Sverre Stenersen, Norway took the first five placings in the World Championships in Falun 1954, and the Norwegians seemed to have regained their supremacy in the event. Their most serious rivals in the Cortina Olympics were supposed to be the Finns, their best being Paavo Korhonen and Eeti Nieminen.
In the opening ski jumping event Stenersen made his countrymen shaky with a bad first jump, placing him on a very modest 19th place after the first round. A totally unknown Soviet skier, Yury Moshkin, surprised everybody by taking a clear lead. In the second round, Moshkin fell after the longest jump of the day (79.5 m), but Stenersen regained confidence after achieving the highest point score of the round. In the third round Stenersen again mad a solid jump, but could not prevent Moshkin from winning the jumping competition with Stenersen and the 25 year old Swede Bengt Eriksson following closely as 2nd and 3rd. The other Norwegians, placing 10-15-26 seemed out of the medal contention, like Korhonen, placing 17.
The cross country event, now competed 2 days after the ski jumping and with the length reduced from 18 to 15 km, was for the first time in Olympic history organized as a separate event, not as earlier integrated with the specialist’s race. It turned out to be the race of the life for Stenersen, and to everybody’s surprise the jumping specialist won the event 14 second ahead of Korhonen. Moshkin appeared to be no match at all, he was beaten by Stenersen by 8 minutes and fell down to 13th place in the final standing. Stenersen won with a large margin, but the struggle for the other medals was very close. Eriksson, later nicknamed “Silver-Bengt” for his Olympic achievement, held on for silver, and another great surprise, the 24-year old Pole Franciszek Gąsienica Groń was able to snatch the bronze medal ahead of Korhonen. Four nations finished among the first four in the final standing, something totally new in this event.

Both Finland and Sweden were eliminated after the second stage, leaving the final shooting to the United States, Great Britain, and Germany.

The very fast pace prevented any breakaways that would allow a rider to gain a lap. Three riders – Giovanni Lombardi (ITA), Léon van Bon (NED), and Cédric Mathy (BEL) – came to the final lap sprint with a chance to win. Van Bon led with 41 points, followed by Lombardi with 38 and Mathy with 31. The final sprint gave 10 points to the winner, 6 to the runner-up and 4 and 2 to third- and fourth-place. Mathy had the best of the sprint, but Lombardi broke out of a late box to second, while van Bon dropped to fourth as Lombardi burst by. Van Bon and the Dutch fans celebrated, thinking he had won the race, but the final points were 44 for Lombardi, the gold medalist, and 43 for silver medalist van Bon.
